<p> Hi! Iâ€™m a junior web developer eager to bring my creative problem-solving skills into the tech world. With a background in video editing, graphic design, and social media management, I approach coding with the same storytelling mindset thatâ€™s fueled my work for over a decade.

<p> Before transitioning into software development, I:
<p> Built a comedic YouTube channel to 40,000+ subscribers and 5.3M views
<p> Produced weekly online video church services during the COVID-19 pandemic
<p> Digitized and archived thousands of legacy video files for clients at the Media preserve
<p> These experiences taught me to combine technical precision with engaging, user-focused content.

<p> During the last 10 months Iâ€™ve completed two programming bootcampsâ€”the most recent being Tech Elevatorâ€™s Java Web Development Bootcampâ€”gaining hands-on experience with:
<p> - Skills such as Java | Spring Boot | SQL | HTML | Python | CSS | React | JavaScript
<p> - Writing clean, maintainable code in agile, team-based environments

<p> Now, Iâ€™m coding independently, creating projects that blend my passion for music with my growing technical skills. 
<p> My goal is to join a team where I can merge functionality, and design, building responsive, intuitive applications that make an impact.

<p> Letâ€™s connect! You can reach me at nkepner@gmail.com
